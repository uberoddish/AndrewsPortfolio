                    <h4>First iteration of my portfolio</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is my first iteration on making my portfolio. I used Python for the Back-End using Flask as
                    one of the primary frameworks, as well as using Jinja to integrate the header.html onto every page.
                    Using Flask helped me to create easy to use forms for my Contact-Me page, and I used SMTPLIB for my 'contact me'
                    that way the user can easily send me a message with just one click of a button. I had lots of fun creating
                    this project. Taking the ideas that I had in my head and translating them into a fully operational website
                    was very enjoyable. I did run into some struggles especially since I had taken about a month to learn
                    data-science, so I had to refresh my brain on some web-developing tools that I had learned.</p>

                    <h4>A fully functioning blog</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>This was one of the projects that I have completed with my school. The focus of this project was
                    the back-end side of the website so most of the HTML and CSS was already written for me.
                    It was my job to integrate data-bases, forms, login authentication as well as hashing and salting passwords.
                    Some features of the website (like the contact me page and the links) aren't functional because
                    my main focus was to have the blog posts work and have user be able to register and login successfully.
                    I used Python as my back-end language and used frameworks such as Flask for my forms and authentication.
                    I used Jinja to help integrate the data-bases for the users and the posts themselves.</p>
